# SnivysServerEvents

A plugin meant to add some togglable events that adds onto the normal round structure

Currently the events part of the plugin is provided below
- Blackout
- SCP 173 Infection (when 173 kills someone, they become 173)
- SCP 173 Hydra (when 173 dies, they respawn with another player both as 173, which are smaller)
- Variable Lights
- Short Players Event

Exiled Permission: vvevents.run
RA Commands: VVE_Blackout, VVE_SCP-173_Infection, VVE_SCP-173_Hydra, VVE_Variable_Lights, VVE_Short

Feel free to fork and contribute to this plugin.

This plugin is not designed to add new gamemodes that takes place instead of the main gameplay loop, these events are meant to add to the main gameplay loop.

@Mostly-Lucid for helping a lot with the SCP-173 Hydra event (and by that I mean doing it entirely because I had a very smooth brain moment)

@Jamwolff for the Short Players Event
